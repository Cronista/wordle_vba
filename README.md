# wordle_vba
wordle remake with Excel's VBA.

With the little spare time I had attending my intership, I've developed my first coding project: a wordle game remake.
It's more akin to Termo at term.ooo, the portuguese version, since it is also in portuguese and I've used the same word list at https://github.com/fserb/pt-br repository.

Some of the .txt files are sketches and models I used. 

The main files are:

  "lista_palavras.xlsx". The final word list after processing.
  
  "nomes-registados-2017.csv". List used to remove names from the main list using power query.
  
  "ref". References.
  
  "OBJ". A crude roadmap and objectives list. The "รง" is completed and " * " is not implemented.
  
  "WORDLE". The sheet itself.
  
  Before opening the workbook, I must remind you to enable macros on the workbook and make the file trustworthy, otherwise Excel won't let the code run.
